# German C and CPP

### Creation

Have you ever sat at home and thought about how the world codes if they don't speak English? Well the answer is that they code in English. How embarassing! I am starting a revolution where we will code in our vernacular.

If you want a truly German C... Well... It may come in 2020.

### Explanation

Sitting here is the source definitions for macros for the stdlib of c and the stdio.

##### More to come

### Inspiration

I was inspired by a Keller Lewis, Liam Middlebrook, and Schuyler Martin. Thank you.
